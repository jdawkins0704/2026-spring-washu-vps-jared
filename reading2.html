        This reading was interesting in the sense that it was something I had never really thought of before. I feel as though AI is heavily shaping the future of the world, but a lot of the time, it gets really hard to understand what is AI and what isn’t. I’ve even begun to realize that when using AI more often, my own writing and creativity start to replicate it. That makes me think more deeply about the reading, as it mentions differentiating the two. What happens when it is someone's authentic original work, but it still reads like AI due to its constant use? Readings like these open my eyes up to these thought-provoking questions that I don't always feel like have answers. Another aspect of the reading that I was really fond of was just the “Turing-esque” test that was added to the author's rubrics. The author's simple criteria being 1. It feels like it came from someone, 2. It feels like it was meant for someone, and 3. It feels like it belongs in a particular context, really resonated with me, and are criteria that I would also like to follow when trying to analyze the authenticity of someone's work. One final aspect of the reading that I thought was interesting was the part on the first page that mentioned the responses the author received when the use of AI was mentioned. The responses were either “of course I didnt” or “of course I did,” which I thought was interesting, as there was almost no middle ground where people kinda discussed using it for ideation or help. It was all just yes or no.
