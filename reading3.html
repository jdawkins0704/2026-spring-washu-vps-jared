        This reading was truly eye-opening. It shifted my perspective on the way that I see and interact with technology. For one, before reading this article, I had a completely different definition of” cyborgs”. I would have described them as a “person whose physical abilities are extended beyond normal human limitations by mechanical elements built into the body”. I definitely would not have compared wearable technology to cyborgs by any means. It really made me think about how many “cyborg” devices I own and use on a regular basis. I also thought that the idea of rooms was cool. Especially how the reading touched on the fact that different smart home devices, such as the Amazon Alexa or Google Home, qualify as rooms. This made me wonder about what other smart home devices qualify, such as a Ring doorbell or a Nest thermostat. Furthermore, it was interesting to learn some new terminology that I never heard before. Words such as “somaforming” and “terraforming” were both foreign to me until this reading, but are now words that I will try to be more cognizant of as I continue through this design class and even after.
