         I really liked this article because of the way it shifted my perspective and knowledge on what I believed a website is. Before reading this essay, I was fairly confident that a website was just a link on the internet that consolidated a lot of different information in one place for easier consumption. After reading this essay, though, I now understand that websites can be hubs for creativity, culture, community, and self-expression. They are catalysts that allow people to express themselves in different ways, which really resonates with me, as it is a major driving reason for why I’m taking this class/pursuing the HCI minor. If I were to have a website, I believe that my website would be a plant. It would start off small with me sharing bits of information with the world. Then, as I grow, the website will grow with me, meaning that as time goes on, I’ll be able to incorporate more information and more context behind my different thought processes. I also think that in another sense, if I had a website, it would be a room; essentially operating as a hub where I connect you with examples of my work and experiences. All that being said, I found this article super insightful. It helped me realize the importance of being able to make a website yourself because when someone else makes your website for you, it loses your authentic touch and perspective.
